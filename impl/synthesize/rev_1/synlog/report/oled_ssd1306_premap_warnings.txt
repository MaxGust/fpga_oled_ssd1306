@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\fpga_oled_ssd1306\src\spi_master.v":139:0:139:5|Found inferred clock SSD1306|clk_50M which controls 55 sequential elements including spi0.inbufffulln_0. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
